Important announcement: No it is not a bug, Roblox has officially pulled the plug for FFlags support. What that means is that certain features will become unavailable, including: player logger, merchants detection (via logs only), Eden detection. What we can do now is to pray that Roblox change their minds and whitelist the flags the macro is using.
