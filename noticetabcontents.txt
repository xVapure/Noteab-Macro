IF YOU ARE HAVING ISSUES WITH THE "USE" BUTTON, PLEASE REINSTALL THE MACRO: https://github.com/xVapure/Noteab-Macro/releases/latest
1.6.4-bugfix1 Coteab update, what's new?
- Also MacOS support for Coteab macro coming soon!!! Approx 1-2 days from this release announcements.
1) New features :money_mouth: 
- Auto merchant while you're INSIDE LIMBO!!
- Anti-AFK, prevents you from Roblox disconnection due to being idle in our outside of Roblox. It will send a spacebar signal to Roblox every 6.7 minutes (I'm not joking) and tab back into the tab you're in.
- Option to enable buff when Glitched biome arrives: great for players who are disabling their buffs to prepare/hunt for a Glitched biome in other servers and they don't want to risk losing a Glitched biome inside their ps.
- Addition of future events.
2) Bugs fixes :tools: 
-  Fixed Eden detection (thank you ethan03228 for the valuable info on how Eden message appears in log).
- Added a more reliable way to close the inventory.
- Auto merchant fixes, now whenever a merchant was detected from logs the merchant teleporter will be used immediately or after the pending actions are done.
    -  Also fixing issues with auto merchant not being able to purchase more than 1 item
- Missing the calibration button for "use" button thanks to "beluga_colevoy" for spotting the bug (1.6.4-bugfix1).
3) Reworks & misc changes :thinking: 
- Noteab macro will be changed into “Coteab macro” as this is a fork of the original macro so we want to add some of our own originality.
- Added another timing method to the session timer, reworked the session timer logic also. 
- Reworked the player logger logics:
    - Player logger delay changed from 0s -> 5s to prevent webhook rate limit.
    - Added a biome joined and biome left and which biome did the player initially joined to the player logger.
- Notice tab overhaul.
- Credits tab semi overhaul.
- @finnerichh will be joining the development team alongside with @criticize.
