If you're using an older version, please update!!

v1.6.5 release, what's new?
- Reworked the UI to be cleaner.
- Brought back pings for merchants using OCR detection.
- Fixed the issue with NULL biome spamming due to the new loading inventory system.
- Fixed a vulnerability to fake ping biomes (thanks to "etcat" for the report).
- Added customizations tab!! We now allow for further macro customizations for users' preferences!!
- I initially wanted to save these for Coteab 2.0.0, but it seems like these are critical bugs that needed attention ASAP, so I might as well release the 2.0.0 UI too :) Enjoy!!
- Also halloween auras & biomes have been added! No need to update or re-download your macro if you're using 1.6.3+. Thanks "callmehelv" for blood dream & pumpking moon icons.
