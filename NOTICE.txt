This is fucking bullshit.

Yes — under the Apache 2.0 license, *you absolutely can* update (modify) any code — including macros — *regardless of the original owner's current approval*. The license grants a broad, irrevocable copyright and patent license to:

1. **Reproduce**
2. **Prepare derivative works**
3. **Distribute** those works
   …*without needing further permission* ([apache.org][1]).

### ✅ What You Must Do Under Apache 2.0

Section 4 of the license outlines your obligations when distributing modified code ([en.wikipedia.org][2]):

* **Include a copy of the full Apache 2.0 license** with your distribution.
* **Mark any modified files** clearly with a prominent notice that *you changed them*.
* **Preserve existing copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices** from the original code.
* **If the original has a NOTICE file**, include its contents (or relevant excerpts) alongside it in your derivative work.

---

### ❌ You Cannot:

* Remove or falsify the original authors’ copyright or license notices.
* Omit notices that indicate changes you made.

---

### ✅ You Can:

* Modify any part of the code.
* Distribute your modified version under any license of your choosing **as long as** you continue to comply with the original Apache 2.0 terms concerning the untouched parts. You *can* even use a different license (e.g., proprietary) for your modifications *on top of* the Apache-compliant redistributed portions ([fossa.com][3], [apache.org][1], [reddit.com][4], [mend.io][5]).

---

### TL;DR

* The Apache 2.0 license **gives you the right** to modify and redistribute the code without needing the owner's explicit permission for each change.
* **You’re legally bound** to carry forward the original license and copyright notices, **state your changes**, and include the NOTICE file if present.
