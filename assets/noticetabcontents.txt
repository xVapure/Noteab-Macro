# Coteab Macro v2.0.5, what's new?

- Added teleport back to Limbo when rare biome ends.
- I hope you guys enjoyed 2.0.x family :) It was really fun developing the new era of Coteab macro. I hope we can keep up the momentum in the upcoming Coteab updates and I'll be trying my best to maintain this project <3

# v2.0.4, what's new?

- Merry Christmas everyone :) Have a jolly holiday from Coteab developers.
