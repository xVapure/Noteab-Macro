# v2.1.0-hotfix what's new?
- I forgot to add some changelogs so here they are.
- Added macro idle mode, all mouse actions will be disabled when this mode is turned on (anti-afk will still work).
- Added obby path (unstable).
- Added & fixed Rin detection, it works now.
- Fixed merchant detection to work with the new Sol's update, in addition added a merchant_close_button variable (pls config in calibrations tab).
- EasyOCR full implementation, merchants and merchants item detection will be 100% accurate now.
- Adding a bit of delay to potion crafting.
